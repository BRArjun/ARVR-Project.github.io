# Blueprint3D: Interactive Floor Planning & Design System

## Project Overview
Blueprint3D is a sophisticated JavaScript-based interior design and floor planning tool built on three.js. It enables users to create, design, and visualize living spaces in both 2D and 3D perspectives, with additional VR capabilities. The system bridges the gap between professional architectural software and accessible web-based design tools, making sophisticated space planning and visualization available to a wider audience while maintaining professional-grade functionality.

## Visual Interface Components

### 2D Floor Plan View
From Image 2, we can see the 2D floor planning interface which features:
- Grid-based layout system with intuitive drawing tools
- Precise measurements displayed on walls (in meters)
- Tool controls at the top for drawing and modification
- Clear visualization of room divisions and doorways
- Interactive corner and wall placement system

### 3D Visualization
From Image 1, we can observe the 3D rendering capabilities:
- Real-time 3D rendering with realistic wall textures (grey brick/concrete appearance)
- Wooden flooring texture implementation
- Furniture placement (couch, TV unit, decorative items)
- Window and door placements
- Advanced lighting effects and shadows
- Multiple room visualization with proper wall divisions

## Technical Architecture

### 1. Room Construction System
- **Corners**: Fundamental points that define the structure, serving as the building blocks
- **Walls**: Connect corners to create boundaries with automatic measurement calculation
- **Rooms**: Formed by enclosed wall systems with intelligent space detection
- **Measurements**: Automatic calculation of:
  - Interior lengths (i)
  - Exterior lengths (e)
  - Wall-to-wall measurements (m)
  - Room areas and dimensions

### 2. Item Management
Comprehensive furniture classification system:
1. Floor Items (like couches, tables, chairs)
2. Wall Items (windows, wall decorations, artwork)
3. In-Wall Items (doors, built-in elements)
4. Roof Items (ceiling fixtures, lighting)
5. In-Wall Floor Items (built-in storage)
6. On-Floor Items (rugs, floor lamps)
7. Wall-Floor Items (large furniture pieces)

Each category includes:
- Automatic placement rules
- Collision detection
- Scale management
- Position constraints
- Interactive manipulation capabilities

### 3. Advanced Features
- **Model Integration**
  - GLTF format support for 3D models
  - Automatic texture mapping
  - Position and scale management
  - Sophisticated collision detection system

- **VR Capabilities**
  - GLTF export functionality
  - A-Frame integration support
  - Blender processing pipeline
  - Interactive VR environment
  - Immersive design experience

## Best Practices
